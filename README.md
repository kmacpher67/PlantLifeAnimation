# PlantLifeAnimation

series of pictures of plant and life animated by human interactions. 
A video camera using Computer Vision detects people and based on position, distance, and a number of variables the plants animate to life. 

Make sure there is enough "root" filespace for this upgrade, the mono-complete, opencv, emgu takes about 5GB to perform. 

Install EMGUCV into a working directory. 
Follow EMGUCV installation steps from here: 
http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Download_And_Installation#Raspbian_.28Raspberry_Pi_2.29
To install mono

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install mono-complete
sudo apt-get install git
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/emgucv/code emgucv 
cd emgucv
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
The mono-complete takes about 5 minutes. 
The clone of the emgucv down to local system on decent Internet is about 5-10 minutes. 
The git submodule is a good 30-60 minutes. Break time to go grab a steak. 

after you get mono & emgucv running the tests helloworld stuff and examples. then try you luck at

```
cd emgucv 
git clone https://github.com/kmacpher67/PlantLifeAnimation.git PlantLifeAnimation
```

After you get it installed local.
